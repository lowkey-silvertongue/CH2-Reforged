# CH2-Reforged 0.1.B00002
"Clicker Heroes 2 - Reforged" source repository.

CH2 - Reforged aims to improve the base game beyond it's current scope and functionality, covering
ground Omnimod (by Michael Drotar @ https://gitlab.com/michaeldrotar) does not and adding some personal
flavour.

Currently this project is in VERY EARLY STAGES. Clone dev_main; branch and commit to public_experimental
if you want to contribute.

-find a way to make gear more relevant/improve ethereal items
-add additional functionality/content to the ruby shop
-more randomization for monster and world difficulty
-new actives/passives for Cid (new meta/gameplay changing stuff if possible)
